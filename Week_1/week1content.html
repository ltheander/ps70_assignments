### Week 1: Introduction and Documentation

![image of my front page](./W1SC1.png)

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <p>As this was my first time creating a website, I had to start this week's assignment by learning the basics. Going in with virtually no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Java and only a limited knowledge of coding from some experience with python, I had a difficult time learning the basics of each program we used and how the files are organized. After downloading sublime text and github and making accounts, I still had no idea how to start working on my website. Thankfully, the tutorial that we walked through during class taught me how to make and work in a new directory and how to push the origin. After walking through the introductory steps and downloading the template for a website that was given to us, I spent some time orienting myself with how the files get organized in my computer and on sublime. I had to ask some of my tablemates and Kassia to help explain how it worked and how to rename files to get a system that better suits me. I was surprised to learn that the index.html file cannot be renamed after my link stopped leading to my page. After a few mishaps with naming and organizing files, I finally got a working system by giving each week its own folder in which the content on that week's page and the assosiated pictures would be held.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Learning How to Code</h3>

  <p>After learning the basics of how to work with sublime text and github, I had to begin the task of learning how to personalize my website with HTML and CSS. I started by looking at the template website code that we were given. I payed attention to how different elements of the code were structured and what can and cannot be changed. I then fully read the intro to HTML that was on the course website. I decided to start small and to only make small changes before checking how the website responded to changes in the code. Until it was pointed out to me by a classmate that I could preview changes to my website directly from my files, I was pushing the origin and waiting for the change to take place every couple of minutes which wasted a very unecessary amount of time. I did my best to learn HTML through trial and error; I would replace a section of code in the given template with my own desired code and check to see that it had done what I wanted. If it didn't, I went back through and solved the error.<p/>
  <br>
  <h3>Making Real Progress</h3>

  <p>I started with trying to create the barebones structure of my website. We were given the code to produce two rows of three pictures and links in the template. After figuring out the indentation, I expanded these two rows of three into five rows of three, producing a website with 15 pictures and links identical to one another.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This was what the code looked like after I expanded it to include all fifteen weeks.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>The next step was to make sure these links went to the right location. For each week, I copied the week 1 page used in the template and created fifteen identical pages, each one corresponding to a link on the front page of my website. I then replaced the titles on the pages themselves and on the main page with the title given for each week on the course website. I did the same for the about me page. I then spent a good deal of time finding images to cover each week on the main page of my website and cropping them to the right width to fit my formatting which ended up being 400 pixels. I then figured out how to put images into sublime text and provided the links for where I got the image from on each corresponding week's page.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is what the front page looked like at this point.</p>

  <p>And this is what each individual page looked like at this point.</p>

  <h3>Putting in Text and Details</h3>

  <p>With having my hands full already learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I decided to stay simple and not worry myself with markdown. Instead, I just used the basics of HTML to write my text with paragraph and heading tags. I wrote out the learning process on the week 1 page, I filled out the about me page, and wrote the idea for the final project on the final project page. I then spent some time learning some CSS from the HTML and CSS page on the course website to make my project look considerably nicer. I decided to keep it simple for now knowing that I can always add to it as the semester progresses. </p>
