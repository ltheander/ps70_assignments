#### Week 14: Project Prep 

<h3>Key Harmonic</h3>

  <br>

  <h3>Beginning of Semester Idea</h3>

  <p>My current idea for my final project centers around music. I plan to make a keyboard-like instrument that is much smaller (15-20 notes). Unlike a typical keyboard this instrument's note change depending on certain inputs. A note can be given (sung or played) to the instrument and it will calculate the harmonic series based on it. Each note on the keyboard will correlate to a partial of the harmonic series. This instrument will be especially useful in harmony making from any given note and in overtone singing. If I have time, I may be able to make the instument have different settings such as showing major scales, pentatonic scales, etc. for a given note. On each key, there will be a movable locking mechanism so that one does not have to continuously hold a note they want to be played. Continuations of the project may include light up keys depending on which setting for scales is selected or a screen that gives the exact pitch of the given note.</p>

  <h3>2/16 Idea Update</h3>

  <p>After discussing my final project idea, I have several updated thoughts on how to go about my project. To make my project more interactive and responsive, I have shifted my idea from less of an instrument into more than a training devices. On my keyboard-like device, I will be able to select from several musical scales or modes including the harmonic series and given a starting note, I will have to play the correct notes in order. The device will then tell me whether or not I did it correctly and will track my progress over time. I hope to still implement leds in the keys to light up the correct notes in a training mode. This is an example of how the design may work as far as scales and note selection go.</p>

<h3>Week 7 Update</h3>

<p>This week I made my first version of a keyboard. Using a buzzer and connecting 12 buttons to 12 pins, I was able to get a functional 12 note keyboard. While this was a major step in the right direction, I still have a lot of progress to make, namely how to have more buttons than I have pins and actually implementing the game. See more information on the Week 7 page.</p>

<h3>Week 10 Update</h3>

<p>After trying and failing to get a working circuit that uses multiplexing to get around the problem of not having anough pins, I decided to use voltage dividing instead. This worked very well and I quickly got a voltage divided keyboard containing 8 functioning buttons running off of one pin. See more information on the Week 10 page.</p>

<h3>Week 11 Update</h3>

<p>First, I extending my voltage divided circuit to include all 25 buttons. Then, I undertook the much larger project of getting the game to work (having a player press correct or incorrect buttons). At first I tried making it so that the player had to press the notes in the correct order but after thinking about it more, the order of the notes pressed does not matter so I made the coding much easier by shifting to correct vs. incorrect buttons instead of out of order buttons being incorrect. See more information on the Week 11 page.</p>

<h3>Final Design</h3>

<p>Head on over to Week 15 to see the final result!</p>
