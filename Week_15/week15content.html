  <h3>Key Harmonic</h3>

  <p>My current idea for my final project centers around music. I plan to make a keyboard-like instrument that is much smaller (15-20 notes). Unlike a typical keyboard this instrument's note change depending on certain inputs. A note can be given (sung or played) to the instrument and it will calculate the harmonic series based on it. Each note on the keyboard will correlate to a partial of the harmonic series. This instrument will be especially useful in harmony making from any given note and in overtone singing. If I have time, I may be able to make the instument have different settings such as showing major scales, pentatonic scales, etc. for a given note. On each key, there will be a movable locking mechanism so that one does not have to continuously hold a note they want to be played. Continuations of the project may include light up keys depending on which setting for scales is selected or a screen that gives the exact pitch of the given note.</p>
