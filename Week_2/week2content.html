#### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting 

<h3>Press-Fit Construction</h3>

<p>Having never used a modeling program like Fusion 360, I had to start with learning the basics. Looking back now, I wish that I had done the tutorial section of the assignment before trying to model shapes to use in press-fit construction. Instead, I learned how to use Fusion 360 through trial and error (with a lot of error). I now know that I used many inefficient methods and what should have been a five minute job to simply model the outline of the shape I wanted turned out to be much longer. While it was not the most efficient way to go about learning Fusion 360, it did teach me the best ways not to do things in Fusion so that I can be more efficient in the future.</p>

<p>In creating my shape for my press-fit construction, I wanted to do something similar to the design of the nano bots from Big Hero 6. These bots, roughly cylindrical shaped with sloped edges leading to thinner ends, could combine in any direction to create any desired structure. To do something similar, I made my shapes with slightly sharper edges for ease of combination. I knew I wanted my shapes to be able to combine in multiple dimensions, so I added attachment points on the long edges and at the ends. I originally had a small circular hole in the center of the design, but replaced this with a rectangular hole that can fit the long end snugly to enable building in three dimensions off of a single piece.</p>

<p>While cutting a 18 by 32 inch piece of cardboard to fit into the laser cutter, I measured the thickness of the cardboard and found it to be 4.25 mm. At first, I overestimated the amount of kerf that would occur. On my first test, I made sure my connectors were 4.05 mm wide but after laser cutting, I found that the combination of predicting too much kerf and having the settings on the laser cutter cutting too hot caused the connectors to be slightly too loose. After the laser cutter settings became more standardized as various classmates and TF's learned what worked and what didn't, I adjusted my model to have connector widths of 4.10 mm and extended the depth of the lengthwise connections to allow for a greater surface area in the connection and create a tighter connection. This ended up being a perfect width for my press-fit construction, and I ended up printing around 20 of my shapes to be able to assemble in various arrangements.</p>

<p>I built three different structures using my press-fit construction shapes. The first was a sort of hybrid between a plane and a scorpion.</p>

<p>The second took more inspiration from trees as I tested how high I could construct while keeping a stable base. Asymetrical root like structures ended up being the best supporting base for this taller structure.</p>

<p>The third structure was more dynamic. I made a flick-football game in which half of a shape which was part of the first loose-fitting series is flicked through the structure to score points.</p>

<p>If I were to do this project again, there are several things I would do differently. I would have started my learning of Fusion 360 with a few in-depth tutorials rather than try and figure it out on my own like I ended up doing. I also would have chosen a shape that was slightly wider. Because my shape was so narrow, only one connection on the elongate sides could be used at once, and shapes that had attachments on both an elongate side and the center connector did not fit well due to competition for the same binding site.</p>


<h3>Fusion 360 Tutorial Build</h3>

<p>After creating my press-fit kit, I used an online tutorial to create a 3D model of a lego brick. During the tutorial, I learned many tricks and tips that I wish I had known before starting to design my press-fit construction shape. </p>

<p>The tutorial started with extruding a rectangle to create a box, on which I added a circle that was extruded to create a cylinder.</p>

<p>With the tutorial, I then used the rectangular pattern tool to multiply the cylinders to get eight that were spaced correctly.</p>

<p>Next, I shelled the bottom of the block to hollow it out.</p>

<p>Then, I created three hollow cylinders inside the hollowed out block by creating circles, extruding them, using the shell tool, and using the rectangular pattern tool.</p>

<p>Finally, I used the fillet tool to smooth the top edges of the lego brick and was left with this completed model.</p>


<h3>Modeling Household Objects</h3>

<p>The two household objects that I decided to model in Fusion 360 were a rubiks cube and a wall charger. I started with the rubiks cube and tried several different ways of construction mostly centering on building a single cube and multiplying it to get the final shape.</p>
