#### Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication 

<br>

<h3>Wave Machine</h3>

<p>For this week, I decided to make a wave machine. I saw several similar designs online but every design I saw was much larger and made primarily of wood so I decided to make a similar yet scaled-down design but made of cardboard.</p>

<h3>Framing the Machine</h3>

<p>Even though I wanted to make the wave machine mostly out of cardboard, I thought it was best to keep the supporting elements of the piece (center dowels and frame) out of wood for extra structural support. I started by outlining one 40 cm X 20 cm long board and two 20 cm X 20 cm long boards on a piece of wood. I then used a band saw to cut out the pieces.</p>

<p>Once I had cut out the pieces, I drilled holes that fit the wooden dowels (7.93 and 9.53 mm) in the side pieces before gluing the smaller boards to the side of the larger board using spare pieces from the original piece I cut to provide a larger gluing surface. I used both wood glue and a plastic nail gun to keep the pieces together. I then used clamps to hold the pieces still as the wood glue dried.</p>

<p>Once I had the main frame of my wave machine, it was time to model and laser cut the parts. I started with the gears. I used the spurgear feature of Fusion 360 to model two gears of matching size (63 mm) but with different center hole widths. One was modeled with a hole of 9.4 mm and the other was modeled with a hole of 7.8 mm. This accounted for a kerf of 0.13 mm.</p>

<p>I first cut the gears out of cardboard but when I printed them and tested them, the holes were very slightly too large and the gears were too flimsy. I decided to recut the gears out of acrylic so that they would not break down over time. Also, because acrylic has a smaller kerf than cardboard, cutting on acrylic had the added benefit of fitting the center dowel better.</p>

<p>I also laser cut three sizes of rectangles, all 14 mm across, one 30 cm long, one 23.6 cm long, and one 14 cm long. I then had to measure them out and fold them to the correct lengths.</p>

<p>Additionally, I had to hot glue the folded bars to make two types of boxes, square and rectangular. I then glued the boxes onto the main bars.</p>

<p>I then modeled a wheel with an off-centered dowel hole and laser cut one for every bar (20). </p>

<p>This is what each individual bar-wheel assembly looks like on the main frame. The off-centered wheel combined with both boxes allows for both vertical and horizontal movement of the bar.</p>

<p>To go along with the wave machine, I wanted to have a few fish jumping between the waves. I used a canvas of a cutthroat trout and outlined the outside. I then laser cut three of them.</p>

<p>I glued the wheels onto the center dowel and slid the bars on top of them. I then bounded the dowels on the side opposite of the gears by gluing a wheel on top. This is how the machine works without the motor. </p>

<p>Here is a close up of the gear and motor attatchment mechanism. This will be expanded in the next model to keep the motor stable.</p>

<p>This was hooking up the machine to electricity for the first time to make sure that it works before building the circuit.</p>

<p>I then built a circuit using a potentiometer which can be seen in use here.</p>

<p>Upon measuring the voltage, I got a value of 5.07 volts. Using Ohm's law, I divided 5.07 by 1000 Ohms (the resistance level of my resistor) to get 0.00507 amps which translates to 5.07 milliamps.</p>
