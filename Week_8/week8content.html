#### Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting 

<br>

<h3>Preparing Files</h3>

<p>When starting this week's assignment, I started off wanting to design some sort of animal and make a wax mold of it using the SRM-20. At first, I made a simple outline of a fish in Fusion360 by outlining a picture of a trout with the spline tool.</p>

<p>I then converted the 2D outline into a 3D model by using the extrude feature.</p>

<p>While designing my fish, I got a much better idea for a design for the week. I remembered an image from my childhood, a picture of me standing next to my father fishing. This is the picture.</p>

<p>In Fusion, I imported the image (reversed as I was designing the negative) as a canvas.</p>

<p>I then outlined the image's details in the same way I did the fish using the spline tool.</p>

<p>This is what the 2D model of the image looked like.</p>

<p>After getting a 2D sketch of my father and I, I converted the sketch into a 3D model using the extrude feature. For objects that I wanted close to the foreground in my final molded piece, I extruded further into the picture.</p>

<p>At this point, I had two completed 3D designs that I could convert to STL files and bring over to the SRM-20.</p>

<h3>Milling with the SRM-20</h3>

<p>With a lot of PK's help (and several power cyclings), I was finally able to get the SRM-20 to connect to the computer and get my designs cutting.</p>

<p>My main focus of the project was the image and I treated the fish design as more of a test run to practice my skills on before getting to the real idea. Unfortunately, the fine details of the fish were too small to be cut using the 1/32" bit. However, the image design was large enough to turn out well. This is what the wax mold looked like after a rough pass using the 1/8" bit. </p>

<p>And this is what it looked like using the 1/32" bit for a finish on the original cut.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fishing pole was too small for the 1/32" bit to cut so I had to finish the cut carefully by hand.</p>

<p>I now had two complete wax negatives of my designs.</p>

<h3>Using My Designs</h3>

<p>Using Oomoo 25, I poured a mixture of 50/50 of each material into the wax.</p>

<p>After letting the Oomoo dry overnight, I removed the designs.</p>

<p>The image of my father and I turned out much better than I expected and will turn into a wonderful gift!</p>
