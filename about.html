### About Me

Here is an image: 

![image of me](./me.jpg)

  <p>My name is Lane Theander and I am a junior in Pforzheimer House. I am concentrating in Integrative Biology and plan to do something with genetics. I am currently working in the Hoekstra Laboratory doing research on Peromyscus mice and their response to predators. I was born and raised around Denver, Colorado and have always enjoyed hiking and camping and spending time in the outdoors. I am also a rockclimber and a musician and will hopefully make several bio-outdoor-music centered projects this semester. I am relatively inexperienced with most of the topics we will be learning in this class, but I am excited to expand my knowledge of each topic and learn to apply these skills to my field of study.</p>
